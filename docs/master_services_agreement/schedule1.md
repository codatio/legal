**External Third Parties**: means Codat’s cloud service provider (currently Microsoft Azure) and Codat’s transactional email provider (currently Mailgun).

**Invoice Period Availability**: is the time (in minutes) in an Invoice Period during Business Hours.

**Uptime**: is the period of time in an Invoice Period that the Codat Product (set out in the Order Form) is available (as detailed on the Status Page), calculated as follows:

2.2 If Client believes they are entitled to Service Credits in accordance with this Schedule, Client must notify Codat within 30 days from the end of the relevant Invoice Period. Codat shall review Client’s request against Uptime and if applicable, apply the Service Credits as a discount against the Fees in the next invoice issued to Client.
